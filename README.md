# Estimation-and-Analysis-of-Mutual-Information-in-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network
This project, developed as part of the "Information Theory and Inference" exam, aims to use different discrete and continous estimators to calculate the mutual information between layers of a RNN trained to perform a cognitive task.
